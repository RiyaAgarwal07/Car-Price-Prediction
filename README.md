# Car-Price-Prediction
In this project, we analyze a comprehensive dataset of cars to build a predictive model for car prices. Linear regression is the foundational technique used, and we further enhance the model's performance by implementing various regularization methods.

# Models Implemented
# 1. Simple Linear Regression: 
The foundational model that establishes a baseline for predicting car prices.
# 2. LASSO Regression: 
This technique adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, encouraging simpler models and feature selection.
# 3. Ridge Regression: 
This method adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients, which helps in managing multicollinearity and improving model robustness.
# 4. Elastic Net Regression: 
Combines both LASSO and Ridge penalties to balance between the two.

# Performance Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). The results are compared to highlight the improvements brought by regularization techniques.

# Future Work
In future iterations of this project, we plan to:
1. Implement more sophisticated models like Polynomial Regression and Support Vector Regression.
2. Explore feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
3. Conduct hyperparameter tuning for better optimization of regularization methods.
